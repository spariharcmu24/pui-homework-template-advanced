## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![Project Idea One](images/idea1.png)

The basic idea of this final project idea is to create a web app that sends positive affirmations to the user that are related to certain topics that they care about, such as academic stress and career. The motivation behind this idea was to help people improve their feelings of self-worth by exposing them to more positive affirmations; this also encourages them to take care of their mental health. 

To make the app more interactive and engaging, I want to give users the opportunity to choose the specific topic they want positive affirmations for. I also will ask them to choose an option regarding how often they want their positive affirmations to be sent to them (daily, weekly, or monthly). I will also ask them which email address they want the affirmations to be sent to. Additionally, I will give the user the option to ask for a randomly generated affirmation whenever they want one by just clicking on a button. 

To make the design of my website more accessible, I will add plain and readable text throughout the entire website so it’s easier to interpret and understand. I will also add alt text to all of the images that I may add to the website. Additionally, I will make buttons, drop-down, and text fields bigger so that they are more accessible for users.

### *Idea 2*

The basic idea of this project idea is to give users the option to self reflect through the process of journaling or audio recordings without having the need to store those journaling or audio recording sessions. Giving users the option to not store those self-reflection sessions can give them the peace of mind knowing that their personal information and issues will not be stored. However, for each self-reflection session, there will be a mark on the monthly calendar shown on the web app that represents the times when the user did some self-reflection. Keeping track of the days of self reflection can help users keep track of their self-care process. The motivation behind this idea is to encourage people to take care of their mental health through self-reflection and the documentation of their self-growth journey.

To make the app more engaging and interactive, I will ask the user which form of self-reflection they would like to choose, which is either journaling or audio recordings. Once they click on what option they want, they will either write about how they are feeling within a text field or record their session. Once they finish their session, they will have the option to either store or not store that session in the app. I might also decide to add animations to different parts of the web app if I have the time to work on them.

To make the design of my website more accessible, I will add plain and readable text throughout the entire website so it’s easier to interpret and understand. I will also add alt text to all of the images that I may add to the website. Additionally, I will make buttons, drop-down, and text fields bigger so that they are more accessible for users. 

### *Idea 3*

The basic idea of this project idea is to give users the opportunity to send themselves letters in the future. The users also have a “capsule” (collection) of letters that they have already sent to themselves in the past, which they can access whenever they want. The motivation behind this idea is to encourage people to get into the practice of supporting themselves and to self-reflect, which could help them to improve their mental health.

To make the design of this app more engaging and interactive, I will let the user choose which day they would like to send their letter to their future self. I also will give them a text field where they can write up their letter and will let them choose which email address they want to send their letter to. The user can also click on a button called “Capsule” that gives them access to letters they have sent to themselves in the past, which can be thought of as a form of documentation of their self-care journey. 

To make the design of my website more accessible, I will add plain and readable text throughout the entire website so it’s easier to interpret and understand. I will also add alt text to all of the images that I may add to the website. Additionally, I will make buttons, drop-down, and text fields bigger so that they are more accessible for users.


## Feedback Summary

For the Positive Affirmation Generator Idea:

One critique I got was to focus on giving the user specific topics to choose from that they want positive affirmations for instead of letting them add their own topics since more personalization will be difficult to implement. Choosing topics for a specific target audience might be beneficial as well, and having 6-7 topics might be better than the 3 shown on my design sketch. Another critic also mentioned letting users request more topics that could be added later. Another critique I received was to maybe use a dropdown instead of buttons when displaying which topics they want affirmations for. Another idea I got was to add more animations or interactions to how affirmations are showcased to the user in the app. Another critic mentioned to possibly send over the affirmations by text message as well and to perhaps utilize Firebase Cloud Messaging.

For the Self-Reflection Into the Void Idea:

Some people liked the idea of not storing the self-reflection sessions (like the journaling entries or the audio recordings of the sessions) while others thought the sessions could instead be stored for a short period of time. There was another alternative that was suggested, which was to give users the option to either temporarily store certain sessions or to immediately delete them. Another idea was to explicitly show a privacy disclaimer to make users feel more secure about their personal information. Another idea was to create an animation that shows up after deleting a journal entry or audio recording. Another critic mentioned the idea of using local storage to keep track of the journal entries or audio recordings. 

For the Letters to Your Future Self / Letter Capsule Idea:

For this idea, multiple critics mentioned that adding animations and interactions can make the app more engaging and entertaining. Another critic mentioned to maybe send the letters through text message. Another critic thought that implementing persuasive design strategies that implement system 2 thinking might help users reinforce their goals regarding self-reflection.


## Feedback Digestion

For the Positive Affirmation Generator Idea:

I agree with the idea that there should be a few specific topics that the user should choose from. I think it will be much easier for me to create a list of positive affirmations for options that have already been chosen instead of creating lists of affirmations for every single imaginable topic. Additionally, I like the idea of having a dropdown for the different topics to choose from. I also like the idea of showcasing affirmations with the help of animations and/or interactions; however, I will only look into adding animations if I have enough time to work on them. One of the critics also mentioned the idea of sending the affirmations through text instead of email, which I agree with since people might check their text messages more than their email.

For the Self-Reflection Into the Void Idea:

I understand how users might want the option to store specific journal entries or audio recordings that they might want to reference later when they feel like it, so I would like to implement that idea. I’ll dismiss the idea of only temporarily storing those self-reflection sessions for short periods of time since I personally don’t the benefit of that idea. Another suggestion was to show an obvious privacy disclaimer to the user to make them feel more secure when using the app. I think if the disclaimer mentioned that the app cares about the user’s sense of security and would only help users store the journal entries or recording sessions that they would like to keep, then it will definitely help users feel more at ease and in control of their actions on the app. I also like the idea of storing those chosen self-reflection sessions into local storage. Additionally, I would only think to add more animations if I have time to work on them later. 


For the Letters to Your Future Self / Letter Capsule Idea:

One critic thought that sending letters through text message might be a good idea, but I feel like sending them as a text message might take away from the feeling of receiving a letter from someone. Another idea was to use system 2 thinking to help users reinforce their goals regarding self-reflection, but I will need to think of different ideas to do that, which might take time. I will only work on adding features that use system 2 thinking if I have the time to work on those features. I also think I will put more effort into creating animations if I have more time as well. 

My Chosen Idea for the Final Project:

Based on the critique I got from other students during lab and my process of digesting their feedback, I have decided to go with my Self-Reflection Into the Void idea since I feel like the idea resonated with people the most. I also think it’s a great way for people to self-reflect without feeling the pressure of needing to store personal information about themselves if they don’t want to.
